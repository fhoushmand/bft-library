Changed the java.security config file in order to remove "NULL" tls algorithm from the disabled tls algorithms
Otherwise, handshake will fail
to do so, redefine "jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon"
in the config/java.security file (notice there is no NULL)
NULL is for when there is no check I assume.
need to change for production



To create a replicated register, follow the steps below:
    1) create "hosts.config{#}" file under config/ directory. This file includes the list of hosts with their ip address and connection ports.
       It comes from the quorum of the object that can host it.
    2) create "system.config{#}" file under config/ directory similar to the existing file. The parameters are selfe explanatory.
        Added "system.servers.processNumber = #" entry to the system.config file
        It assigns a unique processNumber to each cluster. This is done to let multiple clusters run on same set of hosts if needed
        hosts.config{#} and currenView{#} are needed and created according to the {#}
    3) Create and run multiple instances of "RegisterServer<T>" with three arguments:
        first is the type of the register, we support: "Integer", "Float" and "String"
        second is the replica processNumber (must match the processNumber of the hosts.config and system.config)
        third is the cluster processNumber -> you need to keep track of cluster ids to the memory location each cluster stores
        normaly, each variable in the program must be stored in a replicated register. keep a mapping from cluster processNumber to
        variables.
    4) Create instances of RegisterClient<T>(clientID, clusterID) per program variable, you can call write(a) and read() on it
        Look at RegisterClient<T> class, main function for a test



-To run on cluster, make sure you load java/11 module, otherwise "InvalidKeyStoreFormat" is thrown

-For now, the method id and the method sequence number are passed to each method in the partition object
-Later think about how to move them to the runtime

-Check why passing x=1 to transfer results in error (must be a simple bug since this case is very similar to passing x=0 which calls m1 on A nodes which works fine)

-Check whether the ObjCalls are cached correctly at different nodes.
-ObjReCall rule which is implemented in register server and client by adding ids to client methods and a cache (map) from id to return value to the sever code
